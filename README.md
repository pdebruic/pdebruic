### About Me

I'm an experienced software engineer, product manager, and entrepreneur based in Portland, OR. 

I have over 15 years of experience building and launching SaaS products from concept to market.

I started my career as a mechanical engineer, designing renewable energy systems. After starting and running a company that built and sold smokeless woodburning stoves I then transitioned into finance, managing investment portfolios. 

After becoming dissatisfied with working to help already affluent people outperform the market I bootstrapped a startup focused on SaaS solutions.

### Experience

As founder of Cooperation LLC, I've led the full product development lifecycle for 6 SaaS products, including 

* [plainproof.com](https://plainproof.com)
* [getcooperation.com](https://getcooperation.com)
* [treatmentbeds.org](https://treatmentbeds.org)
* [gocooperate.com](https://gocooperate.com)

I handle the software architecture, coding, QA testing, DevOps, security, customer research, marketing, sales, and customer success. 

I primarily build web applications using Smalltalk and JavaScript.

I'm skilled at quickly developing and launching MVPs, conducting market validation, and iterating based on customer feedback.
### Skills

On the technical side, I have expertise in Smalltalk, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, REST APIs, cloud infrastructure, data analysis, visualization, and financial modeling. GitHub showcases my experience across a variety of frameworks and tools including contributions to opensource projects in Smalltalk, JavaScript, bash, PHP, Apps Script, & CSS. You can also find my Smalltalk work on [squeaksource.com](http://squeaksource.com) and [smalltalkhub.com](http://smalltalkhub.com).  
### Summary

I'm a driven, multifaceted entrepreneur and engineer. I thrive on tackling complex problems, whether technical or business-related. My experience founding, building, and growing companies demonstrates my leadership, product sense, and technical capabilities. I'm seeking opportunities to utilize my diverse background in a fast-paced, innovative environment.
